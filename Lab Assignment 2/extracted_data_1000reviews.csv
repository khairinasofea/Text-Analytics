1,buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea headaches can also be experienced i learned my

when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping as the symptoms passed

the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts

5,i know the product title says molecular gastronomy but dont let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creameri have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured food items i really dont think they are good for the body on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffeei stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing of each togetherfor flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughthis stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mixall of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any flavorings it is up to you also would make great housewarminghostess giftsi am sure other molecular people will be able to tell

5,this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakei use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestif you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base,"['this', 'packet', 'of', 'glaze', 'is', 'the', 'secret', 'to',

4,the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homelet me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laps but you know theyre dogswhen we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a lb bag for the price of i think a lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonyeventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much

lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix wa that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homelet me just say this i have had small dog before never have i seen such gas issue both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our lap but you know theyre dogswhen we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it wa a great price for it since we got a lb bag for the price of i think a lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonyeventually we switched their food no more farting i think it wa due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppy they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than wa useful they said up until year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around mo of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it a much but we human like it a whole lot better

1,i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i emailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i dont know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologizeour potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatthanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staffwe are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timethanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same,"['i', 'once', 'loved', 'these', 'chip', 'and', 'they', 'were', 'the', 'only', 'chip', 'i', 'would', 'buy', 'i', 'discovered',

discovered them when i wa in england back in and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that wa on sale at my local supermarket i wa finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chip were not even close to the kettle chip i wa used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor wa way off the lovely extra crisp brown chip were gone completely and i wa very disappointed so i emailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chip the other day and they have a very different taste it taste cheaper i dont know how else to put it i also noticed that the chip seemed to be le cooked a i did not see any of the browner colored chip that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing ha changed with the ingredient or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chip for about year now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting u know about your experience with your kettle brand chip it sound like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspection and we apologizeour potato do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chip should still taste greatthanks for providing u with the best before code from the bag this really help when passing on your comment to our staffwe are sending some coupon to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavor or nut butter believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspection at the same timethanks again for letting u know about this and expect the coupon to arrive within week please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag wa good since that time i have picked up bag of chip all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle wa bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management process are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchant lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base start to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profit make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investor customer and employee lose out of course a doe an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chip they are no longer the same

5,i was getting very worried when i read some of the other reviews here specifically the one star reviews to which i always go to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying itwow they sure seemed to hate the kettle chips backyard barbecue ounce bags pack of that i had bought as ounce bags liked a lot decided to subscribeand then for good measure got orders of the ounce bagsyesi love potato chipsespecially these kettle chips backyard barbecue flavourbut others seemed to really hate themor at least hate how they had changedbut then i realized they were talking about other flavours amazon in its deep wisdom has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all flavours of kettle and other brands of potato chips togetherof course this does have some advantages because most potatochip lovers like me enjoy eating several flavour and brand varieties so comparisons can be made easily also as were all potatochip lovers but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing we are here a sort of united nations of potato chip loversall different but all united in our love of potato chips the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit but evererexpandinggroup here i think but not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum i am happy to report that kettle chips backyard barbeque flavour are totally delicious at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the ounce bags will taste the same these are definitely chips for adults however andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even methese backyard barbeque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavourspaprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweetenersthe complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips in the ounce bags and hopefully in the ounce bags as well is as followspotatoesvegetable oil safflower and sunflower oilhoney powder dried cane sugar honeyrice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredients the combination is a true taste treatof course as with all ptato chips moderation is the keypotatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys the vegetable oil is great but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it as well as sugar has in very large amounts been linked to cancer productionas far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thiscan be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes but as far as the potassium energy good too much bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o ntwice or three times a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small ones of potato chips all day i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials i like the dark chocolate flavour this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks it also teaches me to eat slowly because that one big bag or many little bags never lasts as long as id like anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and weighing myself at least twice a day every day ive taken off ten pounds in the last three months these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettleare totally scrumptious except for those jalapino chips which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste buds i have yet to meet a potato chip i didnt like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips with their combination of potatoes sweetness

me from buying itwow they sure seemed to hate the kettle chip backyard barbecue ounce bag pack of that i had bought a ounce bag liked a lot decided to subscribeand then for good measure got order of the ounce bagsyesi love potato chipsespecially these kettle chip backyard barbecue flavourbut others seemed to really hate themor at least hate how they had changedbut then i realized they were talking about other flavour amazon in it deep wisdom ha obviously seen fit to put all comment concerning all flavour of kettle and other brand of potato chip togetherof course this doe have some advantage because most potatochip lover like me enjoy eating several flavour and brand variety so comparison can be made easily also a were all potatochip lover but each person ha his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing we are here a sort of united nation of potato chip loversall different but all united in our love of potato chip the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit but evererexpandinggroup here i think but not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour review were all together did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum i am happy to report that kettle chip backyard barbeque flavour are totally delicious at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the ounce bag will taste the same these are definitely chip for adult however andor child whose strongerthanadult taste bud can withstand the very strong flavour of these chip they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat wa from a jalapeno pepper chip which wa far too strong for even methese backyard barbeque chip by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavourspaprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is le they come further down in the list of ingredient than the sweetenersthe complete list of ingredient of these kettle backyard barbecue chip in the ounce bag and hopefully in the ounce bag a well is a followspotatoesvegetable oil safflower and sunflower oilhoney powder dried cane sugar honeyrice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredient the combination is a true taste treatof course a with all ptato chip moderation is the keypotatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich give energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys the vegetable oil is great but too much oil a well a too much starch from the potato can hurt the eye natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it a well a sugar ha in very large amount been linked to cancer productionas far a the starch from the potato and oil go thiscan be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eye but a far a the potassium energy good too much bad for the kidney and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o ntwice or three time a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small one of potato chip all day i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade a well a several serving of carnation instant breakfast essential i like the dark chocolate flavour this add up to fewer calorie than i would normally eat if i had my normal three meal a day plus snack it also teach me to eat slowly because that one big bag or many little bag never last a long a id like anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and weighing myself at least twice a day every day ive taken off ten pound in the last three month these backyard barbeque flavour potato chip from kettleare totally scrumptious except for those jalapino chip which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste bud i have yet to meet a potato chip i didnt like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chip with their combination of potato sweetness and spice have truly become one of my top five favouritesif not the very first favourite of allflavoured potato perfection

chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherannette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal noted

moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectlyi also recommend kettle chips honey dijon and kettle chips sea salt vinegarthe honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which

5,i like vernors and drink it all the time it is old fashioned drink from michigan since and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character if you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste vernors has a strong vanilla presence is smoother and more moist and sweeter than a ginger ale it is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale very good a ginger ale is more dry higher in carbonation and has a spicier bite to it vernors has grams sugar per can versus grams per can for schweppes ginger ale neither has caffeinethe recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda companies use rather than the cane sugar they used to use the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors many microbrews are using cane sugar again although it costs more to get a better taste vernors is still aged in oak barrels for years no doubt accounting for the smoothness all in all a great soda for anytime the soda is also known like other ginger drinks for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomachvernors is a regional soda and there are many areas of the country you cant find it in that is why it sells here they may be selling it in glass bottles again soon at least there is a page that says so the day i am writing this comment search at amazon for asin bjkseg to see what i mean vernors has quite a history and there are two books at amazon about the soda the

for it lovely green and gold color and the gnome character if you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste vernors ha a strong vanilla presence is smoother and more moist and sweeter than a ginger ale it is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale very good a ginger ale is more dry higher in carbonation and ha a spicier bite to it vernors ha gram sugar per can versus gram per can for schweppes ginger ale neither ha caffeinethe recipe ha changed a bit over the year mostly in the choice of sweetener they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda company use rather than the cane sugar they used to use the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavor many microbrews are using cane sugar again although it cost more to get a better taste vernors is still aged in oak barrel for year no doubt accounting for the smoothness all in all a great soda for anytime the soda is also known like other ginger drink for it use a a home remedy for an upset stomachvernors is a regional soda and there are many area of the country you cant find it in that is why it sell here they may be selling it in glass bottle again soon at least there is a page that say so the day i am writing this comment search at amazon for asin bjkseg to see what i mean vernors ha quite a history and there are two book at amazon about the soda the first is vernors ginger ale image of america michigan isbn the second book is the vernors story from gnome to now isbn a book about the company marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome and vernors fan

5,im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingheres some of the nitty gritty details each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably or so of the sticks the packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any hassle gotta love japanese product design another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topeach of the packets has calories from fat and about mg of sodium so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option it does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pass it also says on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitheroverall a great snack at a great price the pack really is of the packets so thats quite a few snacks one note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping duh,"['im', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'you', 'review', 'something', 'thats', 'a',

graham cracker youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me the stick themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your finger covered in chocolate while eatingheres some of the nitty gritty detail each of the box contain two individually sealed packet that contain probably or so of the stick the packet themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both side and pull and it open up the package without any hassle got ta love japanese product design another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topeach of the packet ha calorie from fat and about mg of sodium so in term of snack this is a pretty good option it doe contain milk wheat soybean and sheanut so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pas it also say on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also process egg and peanut the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitheroverall a great snack at a great price the pack really is of the packet so thats quite a few snack one note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping duh

5,i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i wouldnt say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess well as long as the chocolate doesnt melt anyways in case anyone is wondering i ordered from a seller named very asia amazoncomgphelpsellerataglancehtmlieutfisamazonfulfilledorderidmarketplacesellersellerajwisei i believe it took around a weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever im definitely considering restocking on this in the future if i cant find a local storeedit oct inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchaseso i decided to restock after i couldnt fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime what i received was not the picture shown on the front page per pack japanese pocky it was a per pack pockyish thing from thailand in my opinion the giant pack compared to smaller packs is definitely a step back packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthpersonally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i wont be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it

5,pocky is just plain fun to eat i discovered these snacks at an anime convention though id heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them they are very very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness the chocolate flavor a nice nonbitter nondark generically pleasing chocotaste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nicethis is by no means a health food its in the same category as a cookie its got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients but hey its junk food we all know its supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless youre really prone to bingeeating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back calories with grams of fat of them saturated i wouldnt recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes in fact just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectif you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones theyre really so good oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout caramel delights cookies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes cookies from the seventies or soanyway if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating fun treatshowever with this crazy hot summer id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather you might get a
